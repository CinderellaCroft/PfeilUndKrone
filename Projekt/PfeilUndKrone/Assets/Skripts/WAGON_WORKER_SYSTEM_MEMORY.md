# Complete Game Implementation Memory

## Overview
This file documents the complete implementation of the 2-player hex grid game (King vs Bandit), including the wagon worker upgrade system and worker visibility system. The game features strategic path creation, ambush placement, and visual worker representation.

## Current Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE WITH VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS

### Core Features Implemented:
1. **Worker Purchase**: King buys workers (30 grain + 10 wood each)
2. **Wagon Upgrade**: King upgrades workers to wagons (50 wood each)
3. **Dual Path Creation**: Separate buttons for regular vs wagon worker paths
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Wagon workers lose only half the resources per edge (5 vs 10 decay)
5. **Worker Loss System**: Proper tracking when ambushes kill specific worker types
6. **UI Display**: Two-line worker text showing both types
7. **Visual Worker System**: Workers appear on resource fields and persist until movement
8. **Cross-Client Visibility**: Bandit can see worker locations without seeing routes

## Server-Side Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `servercode/src/util.js`
- `servercode/src/server.js`

### Key Server Changes:

#### util.js:
```javascript
// Initial gamestate now includes wagon workers
king: { 
  ws: null, 
  resources: { gold: 499, wood: 50, grain: 200 }, 
  submittedPaths: [], 
  purchasedWorkers: 0, 
  wagonWorkers: 0 
}

// Resource calculation with wagon worker efficiency
function calculateResourceValue(distanceFromCenter, pathLength, isWagonWorker = false, decayPerEdge = 10) {
  const baseValue = distanceFromCenter * 100;
  const actualDecayPerEdge = isWagonWorker ? decayPerEdge / 2 : decayPerEdge;
  const decayAmount = pathLength * actualDecayPerEdge;
  return Math.max(50, baseValue - decayAmount);
}

// Worker loss tracking by type
lostWorkers.forEach(pathIndex => {
  const pathObj = gs.king.submittedPaths[pathIndex];
  const isWagonWorker = pathObj?.isWagonWorker || false;
  
  if (isWagonWorker) {
    wagonWorkersLost++;
  } else {
    regularWorkersLost++;
  }
});

gs.king.wagonWorkers = Math.max(0, gs.king.wagonWorkers - wagonWorkersLost);
gs.king.purchasedWorkers = Math.max(0, gs.king.purchasedWorkers - workersLost);
```

#### server.js:
```javascript
// Wagon upgrade handler
if (msg.type === 'upgrade_worker_wagon') {
  const woodCost = 50;
  const availableWorkers = gs.king.purchasedWorkers - gs.king.wagonWorkers;
  
  if (gs.king.resources.wood >= woodCost && availableWorkers > 0) {
    gs.king.resources.wood -= woodCost;
    gs.king.wagonWorkers += 1;
    sendTo(lobby,'King',{ type:'wagon_upgrade_approved', payload: { wagonWorkers: gs.king.wagonWorkers, workerCount: gs.king.purchasedWorkers } });
  } else {
    sendTo(lobby,'King',{ type:'wagon_upgrade_denied', payload:{reason: reason} });
  }
}

// Enhanced bandit turn start with worker locations
function startBanditTurn(lobby) {
  lobby.gameState.turn='BANDIT_PLANNING';
  
  // Extract resource field locations from King's submitted paths for bandit visibility
  const workerLocations = [];
  if (lobby.gameState.king.submittedPaths && lobby.gameState.king.submittedPaths.length > 0) {
    for (const pathData of lobby.gameState.king.submittedPaths) {
      workerLocations.push({
        resourceFieldQ: pathData.resourceFieldQ,
        resourceFieldR: pathData.resourceFieldR,
        isWagonWorker: pathData.isWagonWorker || false
      });
    }
  }
  
  log('info', `[Lobby ${lobby.id}] Sending ${workerLocations.length} worker locations to bandit: ${JSON.stringify(workerLocations)}`);
  sendTo(lobby,'Bandit',{ type:'bandit_turn_start', payload:{
    message:'Place ambushes',
    workerLocations: workerLocations
  }});
}

// Execute round includes wagon worker count
payload: {
  kingWorkerCount: gs.king.purchasedWorkers,
  kingWagonWorkerCount: gs.king.wagonWorkers
}
```

## Client-Side Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `Managers/InteractionManager.cs`

  }
  completedPathIsWagonWorker.Add(currentPathUseWagonWorker);
  
  // Visual enhancement: Spawn worker on resource field
  VisualizeCompletedPath(currentPathIndex, pathColor);
  SpawnWorkerOnResourceField(selectedResourceField, currentPathIndex);
}

// Enhanced interaction enabling
public void EnableInteraction(PlayerRole role) {
  if (role == PlayerRole.King) currentMode = InteractionMode.PathSelection;
  else if (role == PlayerRole.Bandit) {
    currentMode = InteractionMode.AmbushPlacement;
    ShowWorkersForBandit(); // Show workers to bandit
  }
}

// Worker persistence until execution
public void ExecuteServerPaths(List<List<HexVertex>> paths) {
  // Hide resource field workers since execution is now starting
  foreach (var worker in resourceFieldWorkers) {
    if (worker != null) worker.SetActive(false);
  }
  // ... rest of execution logic
}

// Path submission with worker type data and persistence
return new SerializablePathData {

  resourceFieldQ = resourceField.Q,
  resourceFieldR = resourceField.R,
  resourceType = resourceType,
  isWagonWorker = completedPathIsWagonWorker[index]
};
```

#### UIManager.cs:

[SerializeField] private Button kingWagonUpgradeButton;
[SerializeField] private Button kingWagonPathButton;

// Two-line worker display
workerText.text = $"Workers {availableRegularWorkers}/{totalRegularWorkers}\nWagon Workers {availableWagonWorkers}/{totalWagonWorkers}";

// Button handlers

public class SerializablePathData {
  public bool isWagonWorker;
}

public class ExecuteRoundPayload {

  }
  GameManager.Instance.StartBanditTurn();
  break;

// Worker count synchronization
InteractionManager.Instance.SetWorkerCountsFromServer(execMsg.kingWorkerCount, execMsg.kingWagonWorkerCount);
```

## Visual Worker System ✨

### Worker Visibility and Persistence:
The game now features a comprehensive visual worker system that enhances strategic gameplay by showing worker positions to both players at appropriate times.

#### Worker Lifecycle:
1. **King Creates Path**: Worker appears on center of selected resource field
2. **King Submits Paths**: Workers remain visible (no longer hidden)
3. **Bandit Turn Starts**: Bandit receives worker locations from server and sees workers on fields
4. **Bandit Plans**: Workers persist throughout entire bandit planning phase
5. **Execution Starts**: Workers are hidden as moving workers take over animation

#### Cross-Client Communication:
```javascript
// Server extracts and sends worker locations to bandit
const workerLocations = [];
for (const pathData of lobby.gameState.king.submittedPaths) {
  workerLocations.push({
    resourceFieldQ: pathData.resourceFieldQ,
    resourceFieldR: pathData.resourceFieldR,
    isWagonWorker: pathData.isWagonWorker || false
  });
}
```

#### Strategic Balance:
- **King sees**: Full paths (colored routes) + workers on fields
- **Bandit sees**: Workers on fields (NO path routes) 
- **Information flow**: Bandit knows WHERE workers are, but not HOW they'll move

## Game Flow & Mechanics

### Enhanced Game Flow:
```
King Turn:     [Create Paths] → [Workers Appear] → [Submit] → [Workers Persist]
               ↓
Bandit Turn:   [Receive Worker Locations] → [See Workers] → [Plan Ambushes] → [Submit]
               ↓
Execution:     [Hide Workers] → [Create Moving Workers] → [Animate Movement] → [Results]
```

### Resource Calculation System:
```
Base Value = Distance from Center × 100
Regular Worker: Final Value = Max(50, Base Value - (Path Length × 10))
Wagon Worker: Final Value = Max(50, Base Value - (Path Length × 5))
```

### Examples:
- **Field at distance 6**: Base = 600
  - Regular worker, 8 edges: 600 - (8×10) = 520 resources
  - Wagon worker, 8 edges: 600 - (8×5) = 560 resources ✅ (+40 bonus)

### UI Button Layout:
- **"Worker kaufen"** - Buy workers (30 grain + 10 wood)
- **"Upgrade Worker (50 wood)"** - Upgrade regular workers to wagons
- **"Pfad erstellen"** - Create regular worker path
- **"Wagon Path"** - Create wagon worker path
- **"Pfad bestätigen"** - Confirm any path type

### Worker Display Format:
```
Workers 2/3
Wagon Workers 1/1
```

### Worker Loss System:
- When ambush intercepts a path, server checks `pathObj.isWagonWorker`
- Reduces appropriate count: `gs.king.wagonWorkers--` or regular workers
- Client receives updated counts and syncs UI

## Network Protocol

### Messages:
- `upgrade_worker_wagon` (client → server)
- `wagon_upgrade_approved` (server → client)
- `wagon_upgrade_denied` (server → client)
- Enhanced `execute_round` with `kingWagonWorkerCount`
- Enhanced `new_round` with `wagonWorkers`
- **Enhanced `bandit_turn_start`** with `workerLocations` array for visual system

## Testing Notes

### Scenarios Tested:
1. ✅ Worker purchase and upgrade flow
2. ✅ Regular vs wagon path creation
3. ✅ Resource calculation differences
4. ✅ Worker loss tracking by type
5. ✅ UI updates and synchronization
6. ✅ Round transitions and worker restoration
7. ✅ **Visual worker system**: Workers appear on resource fields when paths confirmed
8. ✅ **Cross-client visibility**: Bandit sees workers during their turn without seeing routes
9. ✅ **Worker persistence**: Workers visible from path creation until execution starts
10. ✅ **Strategic information flow**: Balanced visibility between King and Bandit

## Code Quality

### Recent Cleanup:
- ✅ Removed excessive debug emojis and logs
- ✅ Cleaned up implementation comments
- ✅ Maintained essential section headers
- ✅ Professional code appearance

## File Dependencies

### Critical Files:
- Server: `util.js`, `server.js` (enhanced with worker location extraction)
- Client: `InteractionManager.cs` (visual worker system), `UIManager.cs`, `NetworkManager.cs` (bandit turn handling), `NetworkingDTOs.cs` (new DTOs)

### Unity Inspector Setup Required:
In UIManager GameObject:
- Assign `kingWagonUpgradeButton`
- Assign `kingWagonPathButton`
- Ensure `workerText` is assigned

In InteractionManager GameObject:
- **Assign `workerPrefab`** (critical for visual worker system)
