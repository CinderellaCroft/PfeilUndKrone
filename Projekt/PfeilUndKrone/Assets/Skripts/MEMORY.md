# Complete Game Implementation Memory

## Overview
This file documents the complete implementation of the 2-player hex grid game (King vs Bandit), including balanced resource management, dynamic ambush costs, asymmetric win conditions, and comprehensive lose conditions. The game features strategic path creation, intelligent ambush placement, visual worker representation, and carefully tuned gameplay balance.

## Current Implementation Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY WITH BALANCED GAMEPLAY

### Core Features Implemented:
1. **Balanced Worker System**: King buys workers (20 grain + 8 wood each)
2. **Efficient Wagon Upgrades**: King upgrades workers to wagons (25 wood each)
3. **Dual Path Creation**: Separate buttons for regular vs wagon worker paths
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Wagon workers lose only half the resources per edge (1.5 vs 3 decay)
5. **Worker Loss System**: Proper tracking when ambushes kill specific worker types
6. **Clean UI Display**: Organized text showing worker counts in rows
7. **Visual Worker System**: Workers appear on resource fields and persist until movement
8. **Cross-Client Visibility**: Bandit can see worker locations without seeing routes
9. **Dynamic Ambush Costs**: Bandits pay with their highest resource (wood or grain)
10. **Asymmetric Win Conditions**: King needs 200 gold, Bandit needs 100 gold
11. **Comprehensive Lose Conditions**: Players can lose by running out of resources

## Game Balance System

### Starting Resources:
- **King**: Gold 0, Wood 20, Grain 50
- **Bandit**: Gold 0, Wood 30, Grain 20

### Cost Structure:
- **Worker Purchase**: 20 Grain + 8 Wood = 28 total
- **Wagon Upgrade**: 25 Wood  
- **Ambush Purchase**: 12 of highest resource (Wood or Grain)

### Resource Field Values:
- **Base Value**: Distance from Center × 15
- **Regular Worker Decay**: 3 per edge
- **Wagon Worker Decay**: 1.5 per edge (50% less)
- **Minimum Value**: 8 resources

### Example Resource Calculations:
```javascript
// Distance 3 field, 5-edge path:
// Regular Worker: (3 × 15) - (5 × 3) = 30 resources
// Wagon Worker: (3 × 15) - (5 × 1.5) = 37 resources (+23% bonus)

// Distance 5 field, 8-edge path:  
// Regular Worker: (5 × 15) - (8 × 3) = 51 resources
// Wagon Worker: (5 × 15) - (8 × 1.5) = 63 resources (+24% bonus)
```

## Win/Lose Conditions System

### Win Conditions:
- **King Victory**: Accumulate 200 gold
- **Bandit Victory**: Accumulate 100 gold (asymmetric advantage)

### Lose Conditions:
- **King Loses**: Has 0 workers alive AND cannot afford new workers (< 20 grain OR < 8 wood)
- **Bandit Loses**: Cannot afford any ambushes (< 12 wood AND < 12 grain)

### Strategic Implications:
- **King**: Must balance worker investment vs gold accumulation
- **Bandit**: Must balance ambush spending vs resource preservation
- **Risk Management**: Players must avoid resource depletion
- **Multiple End Scenarios**: Games can end by victory OR opponent defeat

---

## Dynamic Ambush Cost System

### Cost Logic:
```javascript
// Client-side resource selection
bool useWood = currentWood >= currentGrain;
string resourceType = useWood ? "wood" : "grain";

// Server-side validation
const serverCalculatedResourceType = gs.bandit.resources.wood >= gs.bandit.resources.grain ? 'wood' : 'grain';
const resourceType = payload.resourceType || serverCalculatedResourceType;
```

### Examples:
- **Wood: 50, Grain: 20** → Costs 12 Wood
- **Wood: 15, Grain: 40** → Costs 12 Grain
- **Wood: 30, Grain: 30** → Costs 12 Wood (tie-breaker)

### Strategic Impact:
- **Anti-Hoarding**: Prevents stockpiling single resource types
- **Resource Balance**: Encourages diverse resource acquisition
- **Gold Preservation**: Keeps gold purely as victory resource

## User Interface Improvements

### Clean Text Organization:
All UI text now displays in organized rows:

```
Role:
King

Turn:
Your Turn

Round:
3

Gold: 45
Wood: 12
Grain: 30

Workers:
2/3
Wagon Workers:
1/1
```

### Button Text Simplification:
- **"Buy Worker"** - Purchase worker
- **"Upgrade"** - Upgrade worker to wagon
- **"Create Path"** - Start creating regular worker path
- **"Wagon Path"** - Start creating wagon worker path
- **"Confirm Path"** - Confirm current path
- **"Buy Ambush"** - Purchase ambush
- **"Need Wood"** / **"Need Grain"** - Insufficient resources

### Path Creation States:
- **"Create Path"** - Ready to start
- **"Select Field"** - Choose resource field
- **"Select Corner"** - Choose starting corner
- **"Creating..."** - Building path
- **"Ready"** - Path complete, ready to confirm

## Server-Side Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `servercode/src/util.js` - Game balance and resource calculations
- `servercode/src/server.js` - Win/lose conditions and ambush logic

### Key Server Changes:

#### util.js - Balanced Game State:
```javascript
// Balanced starting resources
king: { 
  ws: null, 
  resources: { gold: 0, wood: 20, grain: 50 }, 
  submittedPaths: [], 
  purchasedWorkers: 0, 
  wagonWorkers: 0 
},
bandit: { 
  ws: null, 
  resources: { gold: 0, wood: 30, grain: 20 }, 
  submittedAmbushes: [] 
}

// Balanced resource calculation
function calculateResourceValue(distanceFromCenter, pathLength, isWagonWorker = false, decayPerEdge = 3) {
  const baseValue = distanceFromCenter * 15;
  const actualDecayPerEdge = isWagonWorker ? decayPerEdge / 2 : decayPerEdge;
  const decayAmount = pathLength * actualDecayPerEdge;
  return Math.max(8, baseValue - decayAmount);
}
```

#### server.js - Game End Conditions:
```javascript
// Win/Lose condition checking
function checkLoseConditions(gs) {
  // King lose condition: no workers AND can't buy workers
  const kingHasNoWorkers = gs.king.purchasedWorkers <= 0;
  const kingCantBuyWorkers = gs.king.resources.grain < 20 || gs.king.resources.wood < 8;
  
  if (kingHasNoWorkers && kingCantBuyWorkers) {
    return { hasLoser: true, loser: 'King', reason: "King ran out of workers and cannot afford new ones" };
  }

  // Bandit lose condition: can't afford ambushes
  const banditHighestResource = Math.max(gs.bandit.resources.wood, gs.bandit.resources.grain);
  if (banditHighestResource < 12) {
    return { hasLoser: true, loser: 'Bandit', reason: "Bandit cannot afford any ambushes" };
  }

  return { hasLoser: false };
}

// Asymmetric win conditions
const KING_GOLD_WIN_CONDITION = 200;
const BANDIT_GOLD_WIN_CONDITION = 100;
```

#### server.js - Dynamic Ambush Costs:
```javascript
// Dynamic ambush cost processing
if (msg.type === 'buy_ambush') {
  const cost = payload.cost || 12;
  
  // Server-side validation of resource type
  const serverCalculatedResourceType = gs.bandit.resources.wood >= gs.bandit.resources.grain ? 'wood' : 'grain';
  const resourceType = payload.resourceType || serverCalculatedResourceType;
  
  // Deduct from appropriate resource
  if (resourceType === 'wood') {
    gs.bandit.resources.wood -= cost;
  } else if (resourceType === 'grain') {
    gs.bandit.resources.grain -= cost;
  }
}
```

## Client-Side Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `Managers/InteractionManager.cs` - Core game logic and balance
- `Managers/UIManager.cs` - Clean UI organization
- `Network/NetworkManager.cs` - Message handling
- `Network/Payloads/NetworkingDTOs.cs` - Data structures

### Key Client Changes:

#### InteractionManager.cs - Balanced Costs:
```csharp
// Balanced cost constants
private const int ambushCost = 12;
private const int workerGrainCost = 20;
private const int workerWoodCost = 8;
private const int wagonWoodCost = 25;

// Dynamic ambush cost logic
private int GetHighestBanditResource() {
    return Mathf.Max(currentWood, currentGrain);
}

public bool CanBuyAmbush() {
    return GetHighestBanditResource() >= ambushCost && currentMode == InteractionMode.AmbushPlacement;
}

// Resource-aware button text
public string GetAmbushBuyButtonText() {
    if (CanBuyAmbush()) {
        return "Buy Ambush";
    } else {
        string resourceType = currentWood >= currentGrain ? "Wood" : "Grain";
        return $"Need {resourceType}";
    }
}
```

#### UIManager.cs - Organized Text Display:
```csharp
// Clean row-based text formatting
public void UpdateRoleText(PlayerRole role) {
    roleText.text = $"Role:\n{role}";
}

public void UpdateTurnStatus(string status) {
    turnStatusText.text = $"Turn:\n{status}";
}

public void UpdateRoundNumber(int roundNumber) {
    roundNumberText.text = $"Round:\n{roundNumber}";
}

public void UpdateResourcesText(int gold, int wood, int grain) {
    resourcesText.text = $"Gold: {gold}\nWood: {wood}\nGrain: {grain}";
}

public void UpdateWorkerText() {
    workerText.text = $"Workers:\n{availableRegularWorkers}/{totalRegularWorkers}\nWagons:\n{availableWagonWorkers}/{totalWagonWorkers}";
}
```

## Game Flow & Strategy

### Enhanced Game Flow:
```
King Turn:     [Buy Workers] → [Create Paths] → [Workers Appear] → [Submit] → [Workers Persist]
               ↓
Bandit Turn:   [Receive Worker Locations] → [See Workers] → [Buy Ambushes] → [Place Ambushes] → [Submit]
               ↓
Execution:     [Hide Workers] → [Create Moving Workers] → [Animate Movement] → [Check Win/Lose] → [Results]
```

### Strategic Depth:

#### King Strategy:
- **Early Game**: Balance worker purchases vs resource building
- **Mid Game**: Choose between regular workers (cheap) vs wagons (efficient)
- **Late Game**: Balance path creation vs gold accumulation
- **Risk Management**: Maintain enough resources to recover from losses

#### Bandit Strategy:
- **Resource Balance**: Keep wood and grain roughly equal to maximize ambush flexibility
- **Ambush Timing**: Strategic placement to maximize intercept probability
- **Gold Focus**: All stolen gold goes toward 100-gold victory condition
- **Resource Preservation**: Don't spend all resources on ambushes

### Victory Paths:
1. **King Economic Victory**: Accumulate 200 gold through successful resource collection
2. **Bandit Ambush Victory**: Reach 100 gold through successful worker interceptions
3. **Resource Exhaustion Victory**: Force opponent into unrecoverable resource deficit
